# Supply Chain Data Analysis for FMCG Company
## by Virat Gajjar

## Objective
In this project, I focused on analyzing supply chain data for a fictional FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) company. The project's main objective was to extract valuable insights from various metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to help the management team understand the reasons behind non-renewed key customer contracts and develop well-informed strategies for the future.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, including removing duplicate entries and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Power BI: Leveraged the capabilities of Power BI, including DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating essential measures (e.g., OT%, IF%, OTIF%, LIFR%, VOFR%) and designing interactive, dynamic dashboards. The dashboards featured KPI indicators, conditional formatting, pie charts, and line charts, transforming the data into actionable insights.

## What I've Done
1. **Data Quality Enhancement with Excel**: Conducted data cleaning by removing duplicate entries and irrelevant columns, laying the foundation for meaningful analysis.
2. **Key Measures and KPIs using DAX**: Created essential supply chain performance metrics, such as Line in Fill Rate, Volume Fill Rate, On-Time Deliveries, In-Full Deliveries, and On-Time In-Full Deliveries. I also established a monthly target for each metric and designed various KPIs to track performance over time.
3. **Data Modeling**: Established relationships (one-to-one and one-to-many) among fact and dimension tables, forming a star schema, which facilitated efficient data analysis.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Developed interactive and dynamic dashboards with multiple filters (e.g., filter by city, customer name, month). Created three distinct dashboards: one for KPI performance tracking against targets, one for product insights, and another for metric performance over time.
5. **Key Insights and Suggestions**: Presented valuable service level suggestions and product/order-level recommendations to the management team based on the insights derived from the dashboards.

## Key Takeaways
The insights provided by this analysis empower the management team to make informed decisions, optimize supply chain performance, and enhance customer relationships, ensuring a brighter future for the company.
